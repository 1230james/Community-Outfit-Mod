# COM CHECK SCRPITED TRIGGERS #
###############################

# You can use this trigger to see if Morgenröte is active for in a playset.
# This is useful if you want your mod to interact with Morgenröte.

# You can use it by adding a scripted_trigger_file in your mod.
# The File name should start with "00_", so that it gets loaded before this file.
# Add this to your file (without the "#" obviously):

#COM_is_active = {
#	always = yes
#}

# Now you can use the trigger like this: "COM_is_active = yes".
# If Morgenröte is active the Trigger here will take priority and it will result in a "yes".
# If Morgenröte is not active your Trigger will be used and the Trigger will return "no".

COM_is_active = {
	always = yes
}
